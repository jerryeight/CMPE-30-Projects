Please write a program that asks the user to enter a set of doubles into an array. Please allow the user decide how many doubles they want to enter into the array.

Please add the all of the values in the array and store it into a variable named Sum.

 Please multiply all of the numbers together and store it into a variable named Product.

Please divide the numbers in the array by themselves. The initial quotient of   index[0] divided by index[1] then divided by index[2].  Then divide the new quotient by the next index value until you reach the last number in the array.

Pseudocode of part 4

(index[0] / index[1]) /index[2] .... All the way till  quotient divided by index[i]

Then store the final quotient into a variable called Quotient.

Please print out

"The Sum of the array is  "

"The Product of the array is  "

"The Quotient of the array is  "
